# Specification Quality Checklist: Buderus WPS Heat Pump Python Class

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- The specification avoids implementation details and focuses on what the class should provide, not how it's built
- All content is written from a developer/user perspective (home automation developers)
- The specification is readable by non-technical stakeholders who understand heat pump systems
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are clear
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-004 can be tested by attempting parameter access by index)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "under 1 second", "100% match")
- Success criteria avoid technology specifics (e.g., "developer can access parameters" not "Python dict lookup")
- All three user stories have well-defined acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover important boundary conditions (gaps in indices, negative values, etc.)
- Scope is clearly defined with Assumptions, Dependencies, and Out of Scope sections
- Dependencies and assumptions are explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios cover the core flows: reading parameters (P1), validating values (P2), flexible access (P3)
- Feature can be validated against success criteria without knowing implementation
- No Python-specific implementation details in the spec (kept technology-agnostic despite Python in title)

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, clear, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (if additional questions arise during planning).

All checklist items pass validation. The specification successfully:
- Defines clear user value through prioritized user stories
- Provides testable requirements without implementation details
- Establishes measurable success criteria
- Documents assumptions, dependencies, and scope boundaries
- Identifies relevant edge cases

No revisions needed before proceeding to the planning phase.
