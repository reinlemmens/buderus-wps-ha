# Specification Quality Checklist: CAN over USB Serial Connection

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Content Quality Assessment

- Specification focuses on connection management, message transmission, and error handling from a user perspective
- No specific programming languages, frameworks, or libraries mentioned
- Written for developers/integrators as the target users (appropriate for a library component)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 12 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by attempting to open connection with specified parameters)
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (2 seconds, 99.9% reliability, 100 msg/sec, 5 seconds)
- Success criteria are user-facing (developer experience) without implementation details
- All user stories include acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases section identifies 6 specific boundary conditions
- Scope is clear: USB serial connection management only, not higher-level protocol or device control
- Assumptions section documents 5 key dependencies

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- Three user stories cover the primary flows: connection establishment (P1), bidirectional communication (P2), and error handling (P3)
- Success criteria define measurable outcomes for connection time, reliability, error detection, resource management, throughput, and recovery
- Specification maintains abstraction from implementation (no mention of pyserial, classes, or Python-specific details)

## Notes

The specification successfully separates WHAT needs to be built (connection management capabilities) from HOW it will be built (implementation details). Ready to proceed with `/speckit.plan` to define technical approach.
