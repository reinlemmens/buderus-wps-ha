# Specification Quality Checklist: CAN Bus Parameter Read/Write Access

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- The specification focuses on user-facing parameter access capabilities without implementation details
- All content is written from a developer/operator perspective who needs to interact with heat pump parameters
- The specification is readable by non-technical stakeholders familiar with equipment monitoring
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are clear
- Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by requesting a parameter by name)
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics (e.g., "under 2 seconds", "100% validated", "under 100ms")
- Success criteria avoid technology specifics (e.g., "users can read parameters" not "Python dict lookup returns value")
- All three user stories have well-defined acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover important boundary conditions (disconnected bus, concurrent operations, case sensitivity)
- Scope is clearly defined with Assumptions, Dependencies, and Out of Scope sections
- Dependencies explicitly reference prior features (001, 002, 004) and assumptions are documented

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios cover the core flows: read by name (P1), write by name (P2), CLI access (P3)
- Feature can be validated against success criteria without knowing implementation
- No implementation-specific details in the spec (kept technology-agnostic)

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: âœ… READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, clear, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.

All checklist items pass validation. The specification successfully:
- Defines clear user value through prioritized user stories focused on usability via human-readable names
- Provides testable requirements without implementation details
- Establishes measurable success criteria (response times, validation coverage, error handling)
- Documents assumptions about configuration availability and synchronous operations
- Identifies relevant edge cases around connectivity, concurrency, and naming
- Clearly scopes the feature to read/write access with validation, excluding async operations and batch commands
- Properly identifies dependencies on previous features (CAN communication, parameter class, config parser)

No revisions needed before proceeding to the planning phase.
